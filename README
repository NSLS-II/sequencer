ANL CVS path: epics/modules/soft/sequencer
------------------------------------------

This is the unbundled version of the EPICS sequencer. It is the version which
has been in use for some years at the W. M. Keck Observatory. It includes
all bug fixes which have been made to the bundled version and in addition
has extensions for queueing monitored values.

It also has some SLAC extensions to support entry{}. exit{} and state options.

The directory tree is organized as a makeBaseApp application.

Directory structure is:

/sequencer

    README		This file (general notes at the top, followed by
			release notes, most recent first)

    /config		Configuration files (standard for makeBaseApp)

    /src		*.c, snc.y source of the compiler and sequencer

    /docs		Documentation and notes

    /test		Examples and test .st files

	/simple		Very simple examples, for demonstrating syntax to
			new users

	/validate	A little more complicated, used for validating
			run-time behaviour. A very brief header in each
			file describes what they test

	/bad		Files that contain deliberate errors, used for
			testing snc compiler error handling 

	/bug		Files which demonstrate extant bugs in the version
			of snc defined in /sequencer/src


Remaining directories are auto-generated by the build / install process.

EPICS sequencer v1.9.3.p2 (CVS tag seq-1-9-3-p2)
-------------------------

The docs sub-directory will contain the source code of Andy Kozubal's sequencer
manual. This refers to v1.9 of the sequencer and does not describe the above
changes. It will be updated asap to give full documentation of this version.
The doc sub-directory _does_ contain a couple of presentations from the 1996
EPICS collaboration and software sharing meetings.
