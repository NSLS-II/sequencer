EPICS sequencer v1.9.3.p2
-------------------------

This is the unbundled version of the EPICS sequencer. It is the version which
has been in use for some years at the W. M. Keck Observatory. It includes
all bug fixes which have been made to the bundled version and in addition
has extensions for queueing monitored values.

The doc sub-directory will contain the source code of Andy Kozubal's sequencer
manual. This refers to v1.9 of the sequencer and does not describe the above
changes. It will be updated asap to give full documentation of this version.
The doc sub-directory _does_ contain a couple of presentations from the 1996
EPICS collaboration and software sharing meetings.

The directory tree is organized as a makeBaseApp application.
