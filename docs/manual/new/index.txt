.. warning::

  The documentation has not yet been completely updated to cover the
  latest release. Also, the conversion to reStructuredText is not
  yet complete in all places, some formatting may be odd, etc. I am
  working on it. If in doubt, check the release notes. If still in
  doubt, send me an email and I will try to answer your questions.
