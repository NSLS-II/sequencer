-------------------------------

Things to do on sequencer:

- Reduce task priority during ca_search (requested by Mike Bourdua).

- Reduce memory used by each task.

- Use ca callback after (synchronous) ca_put completion.

- Support unsigned types.

- Support time stamp type.

- Implement ca security features.

- Integrate with UNIX run-time support.

Additions from William Lupton
-----------------------------

sequencer mods:

- allow local variable declarations in blocks

- array initialization

- switch / case statements

- ternary operator

- casts (e.g. ( void ) fred (a, b, c); )

- seqChanShow "xxxx","-" not to list unassigned variables

- support re-eval of when( array ) on array monitor

- allow ( void * ) x (e.g. NULL) in function call

general:

- need to make PVPUT etc safe in brace-less if (use do...while)
  (hard to do...)

- error handling (both status checking and failed commands)...

- cleanup code has a problem (in CA?); if delete a sequencer, get
  errors when deleting the next one (memPartAlloc errors in free());
  MAYBE only when second one is a cloned copy?
