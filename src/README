/src contains the source code for the sequencer and compiler, that includes
additions additions made to William's 1.9.2. for entry, exit and options 
statements and handling.

Source code and .st file directory structure is:
/sequencer
         /src              *.c, snc.y source of the compiler and sequencer.
             /seq          Example snc .st files. Very simple examples of .st files,
                           for demonstrating syntax to new users.
	         /test     Example snc .st files; a little more complicated, 
                           used for validating run-time behaviour. A very brief
                           header in each file describes what it tests.
                 /bad      Example snc .st files that contain deliberate errors, 
                           used for testing snc compiler error handling. 
	         /bug      Example snc .st files which demonstrate extant bugs in 
                           the version of snc defined in /sequencer/src. Hopefully
                           this contains no .st files.
