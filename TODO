* Check whether it makes sense to let users specify the communication
  (request) type. This is currently baked-in to be inferred from the
  variable's type as specified in the program text. 
  Another twist would be to allow to use the native type and convert
  on the seq side. The question is if this
  brings any actual benefit, considering that sequencer and database
  typically run on the same IOC. It might be convenient, sometimes.

* Add optional timeout argument for pvGet and pvPut to override the
  hard-coded default of 10 seconds.

* pvGetComplete should support additional arguments for arrays of multiple
  PVs, just like pvPutComplete.

* It would be nice to be able to use foreign typedefs in SNL declarations.
  However, *directly* supporting the use of typedefs like in C would be a bad
  idea, as we would have to make the symbol table available to the lexer (to
  decide if an identifier is a type or a variable). Instead, I am flirting
  with the idea to borrow C++'s typename keyword, so one could write e.g. ::

    %%#include <stdio.h>
    typename FILE *f;

  in SNL code. The "typename" would of course not be included in the
  generated C code.

* Raw ideas:

  - Allow parameterized state sets (like a function). Then allow to "jump"
    from one state set to another one. The "caller" i.e. the original state
    set must wait for the "callee" to finish. The idea here is to avoid
    dynamic creation of threads, as this could be implemented as a simple
    procedure call. Needs more thought.

  - Design and implement an "enumeration" type. Maybe something like ::

      typedef struct {
        int index;
        char *name;
      } enumeration;

    so user can select whether to set/get index or name. Not sure if this
    can be made to work.

  - Invent a new syntax for pv "assign". My current favourite::

      pv int x = 0;                   /* single anonymous scalar pv */
      pv "name" int x;                /* single named scalar pv */
      pv int x[2] = {1,2};            /* single anonymous array[2] pv */
      pv "name" int x[2] = {1,2};     /* single named array[2] pv */
      pv {} int x[2];                 /* multiple(2) anonymous scalar pvs */
      pv {"n1", "n2"} int x[2];       /* multiple(2) named scalar pvs */
      pv {} int x[2][100];            /* multiple(2) anonymous array[100] pvs */
      pv {"n1", "n2"} int x[2][100];  /* multiple(2) named array[100] pvs */

* Convert everything under test to use epicsUnitTest. Add more regression tests.

* Clarify the situation of a pvPut/pvGet to array variable that
  has been connected to separate PVs. Currently this puts/gets the first element,
  but wouldn't it be nice if it meant to put/get all (connected) elements?
  Write to tech-talk and ask (since it breaks compatibility)?

* Not sure what to do with devSequencer. It is ugly, accesses sequencer
  internals, and does not work if programs are instantiated more than once.

* Need to go over the introductory chapters in the docs, remove out-dated
  information.
